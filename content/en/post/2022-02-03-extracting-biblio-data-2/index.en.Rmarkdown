The last [post](/post/extracting-biblio-data-1) dealt with extracting bibliometric data from Scopus and presented some steps to clean these data, notably references data. We will do something similar here, but for two other databases: [Dimensions](https://dimensions.ai) and [Constellate](https://constellate.org/), the latter being a beta version of a platform developed by [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/). For each database, we will use the data extracted to get some information on our corpus and build networks.

# Dimensions

Dimensions is a relatively newcomer in the world of bibliometric database, in comparison to Scopus or Web of Science. The initial advantage of Dimensions is that the [search application](https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication) is open to any one (if I remember well, you just have to create an account).

So let's begin with the same search than in the last post: publications using Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model.^[Keeping the same search allows us to do some comparisons with Scopus data and observe how it impacts networks and other results.] Like with scopus, we search for "DSGE" *or* "Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium". A difference here is that we can choose between search in "full data" (meaning searching also in the full-text) or in "Title and abstract" (see Figure \@ref{fig:dimensions-search}). Doing the first search, we get 27 693 results on February 4, 2022. The fact that we get close to 100 results before the 1990s (when the label DSGE began to be used) means that we could have a lot of false positive. It should be explored more in-depth. But for now and for this tutorial, we will opt for a more secure search, by focusing on titles and abstracts. 

```{r dimensions-search, fig.cap="Our search on Dimensions app", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("dimensions_search.png")
```

We obtain 4106 results on February 4, 2022. That is quite much than the 2633 results of our Scopus search in the last [post](/post/extracting-biblio-data-1#using-scopus-website). But I think that it can be partly explain by the fact that Dimensions integrate "preprints" and we have 1532 preprints in our results. 

To download the result, click on "Save / Export" on the right of the search bar, and then "Export results". Two types of export are of interest for us: "Export full record" and "Export for bibliometric mapping". In the first case, we can export only 500 results against 2500 for the second one (see Figure \@ref(fig:dimensions-export)). This is not obvious, but the second option allows you to export most metadata, including affiliations and the references cited. What do we lose in comparison to the first export? The publication type (article, preprint, etc...), acknowledgements [that can be useful; see for instance @paul-hus2017] and categorization of publications. That is not so much. Besides, it means that, by using the second option, you can extract more results that in Scopus (limited to 2000). 

```{r dimensions-export, fig.cap="Choosing the export format", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("dimensions_export.png")
```



make a comparison of most cited in the two corpus by importing direct citation
