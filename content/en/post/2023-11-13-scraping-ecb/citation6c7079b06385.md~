After a [first post](/post/scraping-bis) on scraping the [Bank of International Settlements database of speeches](https://www.bis.org/cbspeeches/index.htm?m=256), this post teaches how to scrape documents from the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) website. More accurately, we won't scrape the speeches of the ECB's board members, as they are already available in a `.csv` format [here](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/html/downloads.en.html). Rather, we will tackled research documents via the various series of working papers published by the ECB. 

In the previous post, we learnt the difference between static and dynamic web pages. Dynamic webpage involves interaction with your web browser: in this case, you need the [RSelenium](https://docs.ropensci.org/RSelenium/) [@R-rselenium] package.^[See the end of this tutorial for some tricks to "transform" complex dynamic webpages in simpler pages and don't use *RSelenium*.]. 

Here again, we will be confronted to dynamic webpages. However, these webpages raise novel issues. With the BIS database, the main issue was to go to the next page to scrape the metadata of the following speeches. We did it by [finding how the page number was integrated into the URL](/post/scraping-bis/#going-on-the-bis-website-and-launching-the-bot). With the ECB website, the problem will be trickier for two reasons: 

- First, all the documents is on the same page but as the page may be very long (depending on the type of documents), the page is not loaded entirely by your browser. You will thus learn to scroll down until all the documents are loaded. 
- Second, some information (like the abstract or the [JEL codes](https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/jelCodes.php?view=jel) of a working paper) are hidden, and you have to click on a button to display them.

Before to explore that in details, let's load the needed packages. This time, we will use [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) [@R-rvest] in complement of *RSelenium* and [polite](https://dmi3kno.github.io/polite/) [@R-polite]. At the end of this post, we will test a second method with *rvest* only and not *RSelenium* to scrape working papers (but don't spoil yourself!).


```r
# pacman is a useful package to install missing packages and load them
if(! "pacman" %in% installed.packages()){
  install.packages("pacman", dependencies = TRUE)
}

pacman::p_load(tidyverse,
               RSelenium,
               rvest,
               polite,
               glue)
```

## A look at the ECB Website

Let's say we want to scrape the metadata of ECB's "occasional papers". 

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="occasional_papers.png" alt="ECB's occasional papers" width="788" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:show-op"></span>Figure 1: ECB's occasional papers</p>
</div>





We can see that there is 333 occasional papers on the ECB website. Let's try to scrape them. First, we use *polite* to "bow" in front of the ECB website. We specify who we are in the `user_agent` parameter, in order for the Webmaster to contact us in case of problem. Indeed, we are trying here to follow some scraping ethical guidelines (find more developments on this issue [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01)). The `bow()` function allows us to look at permissions for scraping.


```r
ecb_op_path <- "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/occasional-papers/html/index.en.html"

session <- bow(ecb_op_path,
               user_agent = "polite R package - used for https://github.com/agoutsmedt/central_bank_database (aurelien.goutsmedt[at]uclouvain.be)")
session
```

```
## <polite session> https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/occasional-papers/html/index.en.html
##     User-agent: polite R package - used for https://github.com/agoutsmedt/central_bank_database (aurelien.goutsmedt[at]uclouvain.be)
##     robots.txt: 32 rules are defined for 1 bots
##    Crawl delay: 5 sec
##   The path is scrapable for this user-agent
```

By looking at the *robots.txt* file, we can see more in details which paths of the website are scrapable or not. Nothing about the publications path here!
 

```r
cat(session$robotstxt$text)
```

```

```

Let's launch our bot.

```r
remDr <- rsDriver(browser = "firefox",
                  port = 4444L,
                  chromever = NULL)
browser <- remDr[["client"]]
browser$navigate(ecb_op_path)
Sys.time(session$delay) # letting the page load
browser$findElement("css", "a.cross.linkButton.linkButtonLarge.floatRight.highlight-extra-light")$clickElement() # Refusing cookies
```

## Scrolling down and opening supplementary menus

We can try something quickly: we extract the list of the occasional papers number (the "No. XXX" number just above the title).


```r
categories <- browser$findElements("css selector", ".category") %>% 
  map_chr(., ~.$getElementText()[[1]]) 

tail(categories)
```

```
## [1] "No. 315" "No. 314" "No. 313" "No. 312" "No. 311" "No. 310"
```

We got something weird here. The last paper we got in the list is No. 310. But if we scroll all the way down to the page, we can see that the last paper should be "No. 1".

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="last_occasional_papers.png" alt="ECB's occasional papers" width="796" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:show-last-op"></span>Figure 2: ECB's occasional papers</p>
</div>

Let's dig a bit into the `html` code of the webpage. In Firefox, you can go to the supplementary tools and open the "web development tools". You can see that there is something called `lazyload-container`.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="lazyload.png" alt="Digging into ECB's website source code" width="836" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:lazyload"></span>Figure 3: Digging into ECB's website source code</p>
</div>

As the number of occasional papers is quite big, for efficiency reasons, the website does not load the whole information. Consequently, if you want to scrape all the papers, you need to scroll down the page, and you need to scroll progressively to be sure that all the containers are loaded. The `executeScript()` function of *RSelenium* allows you to use some JavaScript code. Here, you don't want to scroll horizontally, but you want to scroll vertically: you thus need to define the number of pixels by which you want to scroll down (let's use 1600 to be sure that we will scroll down slowly). We will repeat this operation a certain number of time 


```r
scroll_height <- 1600
scroll_iteration <- str_extract(categories[1], "\\d+") %>% 
  as.numeric()/5

  for(i in 1:ceiling(scroll_iteration)) {   
    print(i)
    browser$executeScript(glue("window.scrollBy(0,{scroll_height});"))
    Sys.sleep(0.3)
  }
```

```

Let's check that now all the discussion papers are available: 


```r
categories <- browser$findElements("css selector", ".category") %>% 
  map_chr(., ~.$getElementText()[[1]]) 

length(categories)
```

```
## [1] 333
```

That's all good. But we face a second issue: some important information are not visible yet. Indeed, by clicking on the "Details" button, you can access the abstract and the JEL codes of the paper. 

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="details.png" alt="The 'details' menu" width="664" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:details"></span>Figure 4: The 'details' menu</p>
</div>

But as long as the *Details* menu is closed, the information is not accessible. So we need to find all the buttons that allows to click on the "Details" menu. But be careful, we want only the "Details" button, and not other types of button. As in the [former post]((/post/scraping-bis)), the [ScrapeMate](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/scrapemate/) Firefox add-on is essential to find the right *CSS selector*.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="scrapemate.png" alt="Using ScrapeMate Beta" width="938" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:scrapemate"></span>Figure 5: Using ScrapeMate Beta</p>
</div>

We can now click on all the "Details" buttons, and only the "Details" buttons:


```r
  buttons <- browser$findElements("css selector", ".ecb-langSelector+ .accordion .header:nth-child(1) .title")
  for(i in seq_along(buttons)){
    buttons[[i]]$clickElement()
    Sys.sleep(0.4)
  }
```

Now, we have at our disposal all the information that is of interest to us. The remaining issue now is that some information may be missing (or non-existent) for some papers (for instance, one paper has no authors). So we extract the dates separately, and then we select the whole set of information for each paper (in the `papers_whole_information` object), and in this set, we extract the title, the authors, the URL of the pdf, and the information in details. 


```r
papers_whole_information <- browser$getPageSource()[[1]] %>% # we extract the whole info of each paper here (without the date)
  read_html() %>%
  html_elements("dd")

metadata <- tibble(
  category = categories,
  dates = browser$findElements("css selector", ".loaded > dt") %>% 
    map_chr(., ~.$getElementText()[[1]]),
  titles = papers_whole_information %>% 
    html_elements(".category+ .title a") %>% 
    html_text(),
  authors = papers_whole_information %>% 
    html_elements("ul") %>% 
    html_text2(),
  details = papers_whole_information %>% 
    html_elements(".ecb-langSelector+ .accordion .content-box:nth-child(2)") %>%
    html_text2(),
  url_pdf = papers_whole_information %>% 
    html_elements(".authors+ .ecb-langSelector .pdf") %>% 
    html_attr("href") 
)

head(metadata)
```

```

```

Two points of clarification here:

- the *CSS selector* must be selected carefully. For instance, a paper may have several ".title a", because they gather some complementary documents. Paper 209 is an example. So you only want the title after the category. Hence the selector ".category+ .title a". That's the same logic for the "details" menu: you don't want what is in the Annex for instance. Also, you may have several pdf links, and you just want the pdf link below the authors, which is the pdf of the paper.
- the `authors`and `details` column remains to be clean. Indeed, you can have several authors, and the `details` column gathers information about the abstract and JEL_codes, but also, in rare occasion, the "taxonomy" and the "network". That's why we use the `html_text2()` function of *rvest*: each type of information is separated by a linebreak ("\n").

Let's clean the details. you first separate the lines and get something like that:


```r
details_cleaned <- metadata %>% 
  select(category, details) %>% 
  separate_longer_delim(details, "\n") %>% 
    filter(! details == "")

head(details_cleaned, 20)
```

```
## # A tibble: 20 × 2
##    category details                                                             
##    <chr>    <chr>

What you need to do is to extract the category of information ("Abstract|JEL Code|Taxonomy|Network"), and the text below represents the content of this category of information. You can then pivot the data to fill each column for the paper. Of course, most columns for taxonomy and network will be empty. As you have several JEL codes for each paper, the `pivot_wider` will create list columns for each type of information. But you can unnest the columns with single values ("Abstract", "Taxonomy", and "Network")


```r
details_cleaned <- details_cleaned %>% 
  mutate(type = str_extract(details, "^Abstract$|^JEL Code$|^Taxonomy$|^Network$")) %>% 
  fill(type, .direction = "down") %>% # we replace NA values in the type column by the information above which is non NA
  filter(! str_detect(details, "^Abstract$|^JEL Code$|^Taxonomy$|^Network$")) %>% # we remove the title rows
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = details) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c("Abstract", "Taxonomy", "Network")) 

head(details_cleaned)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 × 5

```

Let's "zoom" to the `JEL code` column:

```r
head(details_cleaned %>% select(category, `JEL Code`) %>%  unnest(`JEL Code`))
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 × 2
##   category `JEL Code`                                                           
##   <chr>    <chr>

## 5 No. 332  C3 : Mathematical and Quantitative Methods→Multiple or Simultaneous …

```


Finally, you just need to merge the details cleaned with the metadata:


```r
metadata_cleaned <- metadata %>% 
  select(-details) %>% 
  left_join(details_cleaned)

To gain further insights into the implications of nature and ecosystem service degradation for financial stability, this study assesses the dependencies of euro area non-financial corporations and banks on different ecosystem services. The study then develops a method to capture banks’ credit portfolio sensitivity to possible future changes in the provision of ecosystem services. Our results show that 75% of all corporate loan exposures in the euro area have a strong dependency on at least one ecosystem service. We also find that loan portfolios may be significantly affected if nature degradation continues its current trend, with greater vulnerabilities concentrated in certain regions and economic sectors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |C55 : Mathematical and Quantitative Methods→Econometric Modeling→Modeling with Large Data Sets?                                    , G21 : Financial Economics→Financial Institutions and Services→Banks, Depository Institutions, Micro Finance Institutions, Mortgages, G38 : Financial Economics→Corporate Finance and Governance→Government Policy and Regulation                                        , Q5 : Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics, Environmental and Ecological Economics→Environmental Economics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |NA      |NA       |

This paper aims to provide a detailed assessment of the effects of high inflation on fiscal accounts in the euro area. Relying on the wealth of expertise in the Eurosystem – within the Working Group on Public Finance – it documents spending indexation arrangements in all euro area countries. Thanks to this knowledge, the ECB’s fiscal projection platform, which is the primary evaluation tool for this study, establishes a realistic link between prices and fiscal variables. The results of this paper bring into question the conventional wisdom on the overall positive effects of inflation on fiscal accounts. Indeed, the simulations point to adverse effects from the recent inflation surge, mainly triggered by an external supply shock, on budget balances during 2022-24.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |C3 : Mathematical and Quantitative Methods→Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models, Multiple Variables                      , E3 : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Prices, Business Fluctuations, and Cycles                                         , E6 : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Macroeconomic Policy, Macroeconomic Aspects of Public Finance, and General Outlook                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |NA      |NA       |

As well as the increasing involvement of regulated financial institutions in the DeFi area, the incipient presence of regulatory, supervisory and oversight frameworks may lead to more mainstream acceptance of DeFi. Many DeFi projects are structured in the form of a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO), a virtual organisation built and run on code and blockchain technology. As this new DAO corporate structure has benefits appropriate for the era of digitalisation and decentralisation, the number of DAOs is growing. However, most countries around the globe do not yet have in place a specific legal regime for DAOs. Until now, DAOs have been operating outside of regulatory financial frameworks, even though they may perform functions that are similar to regulated financial institutions or market infrastructures. The legal characterisation of DAOs depends on national laws that may or may not apply, depending on how the DAO itself is actually set up and on court judgements. This paper introduces the DAO structure and how it relates to other methods of organisation in finance. The paper lists use cases and describes the benefits and drawbacks of the DAO structure, taking a closer look at (inter)national regulatory frameworks, guidelines and recommendations in order to discuss whether, how and to what extent DAOs might comply. A policy position on the desirability and conditions under which DAOs could bring efficient, safe and stable innovations to the financial sector depends on the specificities of the individual DAOs, the potential applicable regulatory frameworks and the continuously evolving technical developments, as well as (inter)national guidelines and recommendations.

The study uses the tax-benefit microsimulation model for the European Union (EUROMOD) with microdata as the input – EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) and household budget surveys (HBS) – to quantify the distributional impact of inflation, income support measures and measures aimed at containing prices. The analysis confirms that purchasing power and welfare were more severely affected by the 2022 inflation surge in lower-income households than in higher-income households. Fiscal measures compensated households for about a third of their welfare loss, though with significant differences between countries. At the same time, fiscal measures closed around 60% of the inequality gap between lower and higher-income households. Most fiscal measures were not particularly well targeted at low-income households, resulting in a higher than necessary fiscal burden to cushion the distributional impact of the inflationary shock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |D12 : Microeconomics→Household Behavior and Family Economics→Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis                    , D31 : Microeconomics→Distribution→Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions                                     , D60 : Microeconomics→Welfare Economics→General                                                                         , E31 : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Prices, Business Fluctuations, and Cycles→Price Level, Inflation, Deflation, H20 : Public Economics→Taxation, Subsidies, and Revenue→General                                                        , I30 : Health, Education, and Welfare→Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty→General                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |NA      |NA       |

This analysis is the first to quantify buffer usability in multiple jurisdictions and across various bank types, identify key drivers of buffer usability and assess the impact of various policy measures using longer time series. The paper shows that while both risk-based and leverage frameworks play a key role in enhancing the resilience of the banking system and ensuring financial stability, their simultaneous application creates interactions that may affect the functioning of capital buffers. In this regard, we investigate to what extent banks could have drawn down regulatory capital buffers in the risk-based framework without breaching current leverage ratio requirements, which is in line with the approach to buffer usability taken in ESRB (2021b). We show that buffer usability was partially constrained in the period examined and is expected to remain so under the current regulatory framework and if risk weight densities (RWDs) remain low. This finding indicates that the leverage ratio constitutes an effective backstop to the risk-based framework, both as regards minimum requirements and capital buffers. Limited buffer usability was identified especially for global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) that rely largely on internal modelling approaches to calculate risk-based capital requirements, leading to comparably low risk weights and making the leverage ratio relatively more binding. Adding to previous contributions, we find that banksâ€™ ability to use capital buffers fluctuated over time, generally increasing before 2019 and decreasing after the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with substantial heterogeneity across countries. Furthermore, we provide new insights into the relationship between the RWD of a bank and its buffer usability and find that there is a critical RWD range between 25% |G21 : Financial Economics→Financial Institutions and Services→Banks, Depository Institutions, Micro Finance Institutions, Mortgages, G28 : Financial Economics→Financial Institutions and Services→Government Policy and Regulation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |NA      |NA       |

Grzegorz Wesołowski |/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op317~4b572c363a.en.pdf |Large swings in cross-border capital flows can have consequences for domestic stability and open a channel for the transmission of shocks and spillovers across economies, including the euro area. Against this backdrop, the present paper reviews new evidence for the effectiveness of capital flow management policies in achieving macroeconomic and financial stability. Particular attention is paid to literature that has been used by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to underpin its so-called Integrated Policy Framework, in which the roles of monetary, exchange rate, macroprudential and capital flow management policies are considered jointly. The literature published since the global financial crisis continues to affirm the effectiveness of capital flow management measures (CFMs) in addressing financial stability risks resulting from capital flow reversals; at the same time, however, it also continues to underscore that such policies should not substitute for warranted economic adjustments and structural reforms. Even so, recent literature also provides a case for considering, under certain circumstances, “precautionary” CFMs which could be applied to capital inflows to prevent a boom-and-bust cycle from being set in motion. This paper also highlights the need for further work on the long-term effects of such precautionary instruments, as well as their joint use with monetary policy instruments. Regarding capital flow management policies within the domain of central banks, the literature points to the usefulness of foreign exchange interventions (FXIs) in mitigating financial stability risks in countries with specific characteristics such as currency mismatches, borrowing constraints and shallow foreign exchange markets that are common to emerging market and developing economies alike. However, the literature also warns that such measures may reduce economic agents’ incentives to hedge against currency risks, with the result that unfavourable initial conditions beco                                                                                    |F32 : International Economics→International Finance→Current Account Adjustment, Short-Term Capital Movements                    , F38 : International Economics→International Finance→International Financial Policy: Financial Transactions Tax; Capital Controls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |NA      |NA       |

And you now have a nice table of metadata for ECB occasional papers! The [post on the BIS](/post/scraping-bis) explains then how to download the PDF, and how to run OCR if the text of the PDFs is not searchable. This code is alos working for ECB's "discussion papers" and "working papers".

## Another Method?

You can use the method above to scrape the metadata for the almost 3000 thousands working papers of the ECB. But you can imagine that it takes a very long time to scroll down the page, and above all to open all the "Details" menu. *RSelenium* is wonderfully useful to interact with web browser, but sometimes, by digging into the source code of a webpage, you may find easier ways to extract relevant information. 

And this is possible for the ECB research pages. We already add a clue of it above in this post. Indeed, let's look again at the code related to the "lazyload-container". 

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="lazyload.png" alt="Digging into ECB's website code" width="836" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:lazyload-again"></span>Figure 6: Digging into ECB's website code</p>
</div>

Actually it tells us that the website is loading some other pages, ending with "papers-2023.include.en.html", "papers-2022.include.en.html", etc., until "papers-1999.include.en.html". Let's try the first one: "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/papers-2023.include.en.html"

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="lazyload.png" alt="A simpler ECB page" width="836" />
<p class="caption"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-10"></span>Figure 7: A simpler ECB page</p>
</div>

So we can scrape quite easily the occasional-papers for 2023:


```r
url <- "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/occasional-papers/html/papers-2023.include.en.html"

html_info <- read_html(url) %>%
  html_elements(xpath = "/html/body/dd")

metadata <- tibble(
  category = html_info %>% 
    html_elements(".category") %>% 
    html_text(),
  dates = read_html(url) %>%
    html_elements(".date") %>%
    html_text(),
  titles = html_info %>% 
    html_elements(".category+ .title a") %>% 
    html_text(),
  authors = html_info %>% 
    html_elements("ul") %>% 
    html_text2(),
  details = html_info %>% 
    html_elements(".ecb-langSelector+ .accordion .content-box:nth-child(2)") %>%
    html_text2(),
  url_pdf = html_info %>% 
    html_elements(".pdf") %>% 
    html_attr("href") 
)

head(metadata)
```
