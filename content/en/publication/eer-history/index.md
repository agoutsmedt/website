abstract: "Economics in Europe has encountered a process of internationalisation since the
1970s. To a certain extent, this internationalisation is also an ‘Americanisation’
and many European departments and economics have adopted the standards of
US economics, notably mathematical modelling, the use of econometrics, and
the neoclassical theory as a modelling benchmark. Regarding this process, we
can wonder if European economics has just been mimicking US economics since
the 1970s, or if some European specialities have survived or emerged.
In this article, we use topic modelling and bibliometric coupling to identify
what have been some European specialities between 1969 and 2002. We focus on
macroeconomics, and we use the articles published in the European Economic
Review and compare their bibliographic references and textual content (via titles
and abstracts) to what has been published in the top 5 journals.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, disequilibrium theory constituted a significant
part of the research undertaken by European macroeconomists, and
did not limit to the GET, but also represented a unifying framework to deal
with different macroeconomic issues. After it lose its influence in the second
part of the 1980s, political economy occupied this role. It constituted a resource
for tackling the issues raised by the European integration and the building of
a European monetary system, and constituted a common language for many
European macroeconomists."
