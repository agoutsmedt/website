I am a historian of economics and I work on the history of macroeconomics and economic expertise since the 1970s, using quantitative and qualitative methods.

I am currently involved in a collective project funded by Rebuilding Macroeconomics on “[Excavating the Academia/Policy Pipeline: Economic analysis at the Bank of England Pre and Post-Crisis](https://www.rebuildingmacroeconomics.ac.uk/academia-policy-pipeline)”.

I am also working on a quantitative history of macroeconomics (1970-2020) with [Alexandre Truc](https://sites.google.com/view/alexandre-truc/home-and-contact). This project is funded by the History of Economics Society and aims at developing an interactive platform displaying our results. We are developing [R packages](https://github.com/agoutsmedt/biblionetwork) to apply network analysis to bibliometric data. 

I am an elected member of the Board of [Charles Gide Association for the Study of Economic Thought](http://www.charlesgide.fr/). I am also a member of the network for the history and philosophy of recent economics, [REHPERE](https://rehpere.org/), and a managing editor of [OEconomia](https://journals.openedition.org/oeconomia/), in charge of the book review section.
