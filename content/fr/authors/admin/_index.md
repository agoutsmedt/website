I am a historian of economics and I work on the history of macroeconomics and economic expertise since the 1970s. I received my Ph.D. in Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, and I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at Université du Québec à Montréal, in the Centre Interuniversitaire de Recherche sur la Science et la Technologie ([CIRST](https://www.cirst.uqam.ca/)).

I am currently involved in a collective project funded by Rebuilding Macroeconomics on “[Excavating the Academia/Policy Pipeline: Economic analysis at the Bank of England Pre and Post-Crisis](https://www.rebuildingmacroeconomics.ac.uk/academia-policy-pipeline)”.

I am also working on a quantitative history of macroeconomics (1970-2020) with [Alexandre Truc](https://sites.google.com/view/alexandre-truc/home-and-contact). This project is funded by the History of Economics Society and aims at developing an interactive platform displaying our results. We are developing [R packages](https://github.com/agoutsmedt/biblionetwork) to apply network analysis to bibliometric data.
