  abstract = {This paper reviews the way in which constructivist or anti-representationalist arguments have been used as an argument in favor of changing the way we write the history of economic thought. It is argued that though such arguments provide some important new perspectives on the subject, their use as a comprehensive methodological critique of ``traditional'' approaches to the subject rests on the theses that a non-foundationalist methodology is impossible, and that we can assume that contemporary economics is in a healthy state. If these theses are not accepted, the case against ``traditional'' histories collapses.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the sociological approach's new lease on life and how it relates to the discipline of economics in general and the history of economic thought in particular. There are three important things to keep in mind. First, there is clearly a sense in which sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) seems to be less radical in economics than in natural science. The idea that economists' beliefs are determined by social factors is hardly surprising. In the case of economics the issue is not social versus nature; it is the right kind of social versus the wrong kind of social. Second, SSK is not equivalent to rich, deeply textured, thick history. The two are certainly correlated but they are neither necessary nor sufficient for each other. There are various interest-based explanations in SSK that are relatively thin, and there are many thick histories outside of science that are certainly not SSK. The reason SSK is sometimes equated with thick history is that so much non-SSK history of science is so thin. SSK comes into being and exists only in contrast to the pristine and hagiographic vision of the scientific enterprise; debunking, like satire, works most effectively against the self-assured.},

It offers a non-canonical typology comprising three alternative approaches, distinguished on the basis of the way they conceive of the link between statements, old and contemporary: the extensive, the retrospective, and the intensive approaches. It shows that the latter potentially challenges contemporary knowledge by introducing statements which do not belong to it. Despite its being a heuristic, it appears as a privileged route by which the history of economic thought can begin to engage with economic theory.},

Existing ``presentist'' type histories have been criticized for their ``Whiggish'' assumptions about scientific progress. The critique of presentism is the product of a new school of historians of social science who advocate a ``historicist'' historiography. My paper is addressed to this discussion and falls into three parts. First, I review the principles of presentist and historicist historiographies, relating their methodological positions to their theories of science. Second, I take up the argument of the ``new historicism'' in more detail, criticizing its theory of textual interpretation and its theory of social scientific development. I conclude by offering an alternative historiographic model of social scientific development based upon a theory of science that I outline.},

Abiding by this narrative with respect to scientists' imagined pasts would lead historians to presume that flaws in scientists' historical understanding are reflections of flaws in scientists' thinking more generally. Simon Schaffer's work on the evolution and ``end'' of natural philosophy is exemplary of the historiographical rewards to be expected from careful research into the totality of scientific figures' understanding of their own work.},
